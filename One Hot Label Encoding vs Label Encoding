📘 One-Hot Encoding vs Label Encoding (Humanised Explanation)

When working with datasets, we often come across columns that contain text values — like gender, colors, cities, or product categories.
Since machine learning models only understand numbers, we need a way to convert these text labels into numeric form.
Two common techniques for this are Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

🔸 Label Encoding

Label Encoding simply replaces each category with a unique number.

For example:

Female → 0

Male → 1

It’s easy and compact, but it comes with a catch:
If the categories do not have any natural order, the model may mistakenly think that one value is greater than the other.
This can confuse the model.

Best used when the categories actually have an order, such as:

Small < Medium < Large

Beginner < Intermediate < Expert

Here, numeric labels correctly represent the progression.

🔹 One-Hot Encoding

One-Hot Encoding takes a different approach.
Instead of assigning a number, it creates new columns, one for each category, and marks them with 0 or 1.

Example for the “Sex” column:

Sex_Male

Sex_Female

Each row gets a 1 in the column that matches its category.

This method does not imply any ranking between categories, making it ideal for situations where the categories are simply different and not ordered, such as:

Colors

Countries

Animals

Gender

The only downside is that it creates more columns, especially if there are many categories.

⭐ In Simple Words

Use Label Encoding when the categories have a natural order.

Use One-Hot Encoding when they don’t.

Choosing the right method helps the model learn correctly and prevents false assumptions.
